# libspatialindex

The purpose of this library is to provide:

- An extensible framework that will support robust spatial indexing methods.
- Support for sophisticated spatial queries. Range, point location, nearest neighbor and k-nearest neighbor as well as parametric queries (defined by spatial constraints) should be easy to deploy and run.
- Easy to use interfaces for inserting, deleting and updating information.
- Wide variety of customization capabilities. Basic index and storage characteristics like the page size, node capacity, minimum fan-out, splitting algorithm, etc. should be easy to customize.
- Index persistence. Internal memory and external memory structures should be supported. Clustered and non-clustered indices should be easy to be persisted.

## Features

- Generic main memory and disk based storage managers.
- R*-tree index (also supports linear and quadratic splitting).
- MVR-tree index (a.k.a. PPR-tree).
- TPR-tree index.
- Advanced query capabilities, using Strategy and Visitor patterns.
- Arbitrary shaped range queries, by defining generic geometry interfaces.
- Large parameterization capabilities, including dimensionality, fill factor, node capacity, etc.
- STR packing / bulk loading.

## Warnings

The library is not thread-safe, even for seemingly read-only operations. Queries and updates must be run from within mutexes.
